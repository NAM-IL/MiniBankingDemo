## Opening the project in Android Studio

It's best to open the project by using the **File > New > Import project** command.

If the build process fails, try:
* **File > Sync project with gradle files**
* **Build > Rebuild Project**
* **File > Invalidate caches / Restart**

## Scope
The keep the effort within reasonable limits, things that some could
consider necessary are deliberately left out of scope.

**Out of scope**:
* Savings goals details like description, picture, target
* UI polishing and theming
* Progress/busy indicator
* Swipe to refresh
* Support for older devices
* Maximum test coverage
* Optimizations
* User friendly error messages
* and others :)
